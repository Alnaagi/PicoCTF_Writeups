**Description**<br>

Figure out how they moved the [flag](https://mercury.picoctf.net/static/ed308d382ae6bcc37a5ebc701a1cc4f4/tftp.pcapng).

**Hints**<br>

1-What are some other ways to hide data?<br>

# Solution

1- the ctf is named Trivial Flag Transfer Protocol so it has something to do with tftp. <br>

2-Upon opening the pcapng file in Wireshark, frame 1 immediately caught my eye within Wireshark, I observed a TFTP transfer for "instructions.txt". <br>

![](tftp.pcap.png)<br>

Leveraging Wireshark's export capability `File->Export Objects->TFTP` , I retrieved the file and subsequently identified additional hidden objects. All files were then downloaded and archived, initiating the flag extraction process.<br>

3-First thing I did was open instructions.txt, which contained an encrypted text. <br>
![](instructions.png)<br>
I didn't know what kind of encryption it was, so I entered it into a  [cipher identifier](https://www.dcode.fr/cipher-identifier). The result identified it as a ROT-13 cipher [ROT-13 cipher](https://www.dcode.fr/rot-13-cipher), so I decrypted the text, and the result was:<br>
`TFTPDOESNTENCRYPTOURTRAFFICSOWEMUSTDISGUISEOURFLAGTRANSFER FIGUREOUTAWAYTOHIDETHEFLAGANDIWILLCHECKBACKFORTHEPLAN`.<br>

>TFTP DOESNT ENCRYPT OUR TRAFFIC SO WE MUST DISGUISE OUR FLAG TRANSFER FIGURE OUT AWAY TO HIDE THE FLAG AND IWILL CHECK BACK FOR THE PLAN.<br>

then opened up file named plan it contained another [ROT-13 Cipher](https://www.dcode.fr/rot-13-cipher) the Result :<br>

![](plan.png)<br>

the Result :<br>

`IUSEDTHEPROGRAMANDHIDITWITH-DUEDILIGENCE.CHECKOUTTHEPHOTOS`<br>

>I USED THE PROGRAM AND HID IT WITH -DUE DILIGENCE. CHECK OUT THE PHOTOS<br>

These are the Pictures : 

>picture1.bmp<br>

![](picture1.bmp)<br>

>picture2.bmp<br>

![](picture2.bmp)<br>

>picture3.bmp<br>

![](picture3.bmp)<br>

After further inspection, I ran the `sudo dpkg -i program.deb` command to install the program.<br>
The program name, turned out to be Steghide, a tool to embed or extract information from and into files.<br>

To understand the program's functionalities, I read the `steghide --help` manual. Then, I tried using the command `steghide extract -sf picture1.bmp`, but it asked me for a passphrase :<br>

They didn't provide one in the CTF description nor the hints, so either I needed to look for the passphrase or I was doing something wrong.<br>

Thinking back, I found myself questioning the lack of instructions. Then, I remembered a phrase in the decrypted plan file:<br> 
"IUSEDTHEPROGRAMANDHIDITWITH-DUEDILIGENCE.CHECKOUTTHEPHOTOS".<br>

The oddly phrased word "DUEDILIGENCE" sparked my curiosity, so I tried it on picture1.bmp - unfortunately, `steghide: could not extract any data with that passphrase!`<br>

![](phrasepic1.png)<br>

same thing with picture2.bmp :<br>

![](phrasepic2.png)<br>

but picture3.bmp contained a file named `flag.txt`<br>

![](phrasepic3.png)<br>

the file `flag.txt` contained the flag`picoCTF{h1dd3n_1n_pLa1n_51GHT_18375919}`<br>

![](flag.png)<br>

4- the flag is:`picoCTF{h1dd3n_1n_pLa1n_51GHT_18375919}`<br>

Not what I'd call plain sight,Â but the journey was worth the destination.<br>
Let's just say I learned a thing or two!
